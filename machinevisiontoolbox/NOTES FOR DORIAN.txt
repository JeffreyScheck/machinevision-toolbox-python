pip install ansitable


Converting functions to methods

* first argument is self
* second argument im is deleted, self is the image
* to convert an ndarray or list of ndarrays to an image, you can't call Image(array) but instead call self.__class__()
* it's the same thing but avoids problems with circular imports

To test if something is an empty list

    if thing is []:
        stuff

* There is never a need to do this test


    if isinstance(self, Image):

because if the method is invoked, self must be an Image

Output of grey() seems to produce weird colors, not greyscale.  Maybe it's the colormap

Blob parent/child for multiblobs.png doesnt look right.


ImageProcessing.py, I've tweaked int, float, mono.  Please use similar
coding and docstring patterns for all the rest.

Please build unit tests for all the different Image constructor options

idisp() need to talk about options, the opt/kwargs thing is valid, but it would 
be better if all the args were listed as call arguments, then the docstring
:param:, :type: markup can be used.
