Image processing and feature extraction
***************************************

The ``Image`` class is a core part of this Toolbox.  It encapsulates one or
more NumPy arrays, each of which represents a greyscale or color image as
a 2D or 3D array respectively.

An ``Image`` instance has a very large number of methods that perform useful
operations on an image and wrap low-level operations performed using NumPy or
OpenCV.
